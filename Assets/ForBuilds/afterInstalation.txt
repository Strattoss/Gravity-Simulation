# Keyboard Controls:
* WASD: Move the camera to explore the 3D environment.

* Shift + WASD: Accelerate the camera movement speed for faster navigation.

* Mouse scroll: Move the camera forward or backward along the scene.

* Up/Down Arrows: Adjust the simulation speed, making it faster or slower.

* P: Predict bodies' movement and observe their future positions.

* 1-9: Set the simulation speed to respective numbers for precise control.

* Tilde (~): Stop the simulation, pausing all motion.

* Numpad 1, 2, 3: Control force vectors - 1: Increase length, 2: Toggle visibility, 3: Decrease length.

* Numpad 4, 5, 6: Control momentum vectors - 4: Increase length, 5: Toggle visibility, 6: Decrease length.

* Numpad 7, 8, 9: Control velocity vectors - 7: Increase length, 8: Toggle visibility, 9: Decrease length.

(Note: "Change length" refers to multiplying vector length by a factor, adjustable by the user)

* Left/Right Arrows: Navigate between previous and next scenes for a diverse simulation experience.

* Escape: Quit the program
